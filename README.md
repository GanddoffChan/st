# st (suckless terminal)

orig: [suckless terminal (st)](https://st.suckless.org/)

## added patches

Any size: allows st to resize to any pixel size, makes the inner border size dynamic, and centers the content of the terminal so that the left/right and top/bottom borders are balanced

Bold is not bright: makes bold text rendered simply as bold, leaving the color unaffected

Dynamic cursor color: swaps the colors of your cursor and the character you're currently on

Right click paste: pressing right-click pastes from the primary-selection

Scroll back: scroll back through terminal output using `alt-j` and `alt-k`; faster scrolls are done with `alt-d` and `alt-u`; mouse scrolls are also supported
